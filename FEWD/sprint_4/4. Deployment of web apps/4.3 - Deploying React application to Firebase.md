## Introduction

*Deploying React apps to Firebase*

As we studied in the previous topic, Firebase is a development platform acquired by Google in 2014. It simplifies hosting web applications. In the following tutorial, we will learn how to deploy our create-react-app application to Firebase.

Pre-requisite: You need to have node and npm installed in your machine. 

## What you must do?

This section will be a combination of tutorial and practice. While completing this tutorial, you will eventually be able to deploy your ‘Build My Burger’ application to Firebase.

Before you begin following the steps mentioned in the tutorial link given below, make note of the following things:

a)	The first step in the link(given below) asks you to create a fresh app. There is no need to complete the first step as you already have a ready application.

b)	In the step two: In the latest version of Firebase, as of October 19, 2019, once you login to Firebase and go to ‘Create a new project’, the option to create a web app project is denoted by </>.

c)	In step three: When you press the command firebase init, the CLI will ask you whether you want to replace the current index.html file. You should press N. Pressing y will replace your index.html with Firebase custom text.

d)	If at any point, you receive an error like Failed to list Firebase projects, simply do firebase logout and firebase login to continue.
