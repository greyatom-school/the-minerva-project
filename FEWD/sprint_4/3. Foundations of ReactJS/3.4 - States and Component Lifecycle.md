# States & Component lifecycle

## Overview

In this topic, we will understand one of the most important part of the component called state.  

State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.

 For example: In the 'My Burger' app, you may want to change the ingredients information depending upon the availability. 

After that, we will go through another important feature which sets React apart from other frameworks. This feature is called the Component lifecycle.



## Learning Outcome

- What is the state of a component?
- How to create the state and modify the state of a component?
- What are the different lifecycle methods of the component?
- When and how to use these different lifecycle methods of the component?


## Introduction

*State*

React components have a built-in state object.
The state object is where property values that belongs to the component is stored

Whenever the state object changes, the component also re-renders.
It is used to update the component in response to user actions(like clicking button, pressing some key, etc.),  network responses, and anything


*Component Lifecycle*

Each component in React has a lifecycle which we can monitor and manipulate during its different phases.

The  phases are:  Initialization, Mounting, Updating and Unmounting

Intitalisation: Defining defaults and initial values for states

Mounting: Putting elements into the DOM

Updating: Modify component's states

Unmounting: Removing elements from the DOM


## What must you do?


-	Familiarise yourself with [what State is in ReactJS](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_state.asp)

-	Next, Read and understand [how they have changed the component created earlier into a class-based component to accommodate state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html). Read the section up to ‘Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class’.

-	After that, take a [look at graphical description of the component life-cycle and understand when each of the life-cycle methods are called](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-lifecycle-components/)

-	Once you complete reading the above article, check out the [list of lifecycle methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) there are in React. Pay close attention to the lifecycle methods which are now considered unsafe. 

- Go through[ this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa5xrXNvIyU) on component lifecycle methods.

-	Finally, go back to the second link [page](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) and continue reading from the ‘Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class’ till the end. 
Make an important note of the Using State Correctly section.



## Additional Resources

- If you still feel confused by the lifecycle methods, read and and get a thorough understanding of [every lifecycle method in detail with an example](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lifecycle.asp)

- Read the section titled **Common React Lifecycle Methods** in [this article](https://programmingwithmosh.com/javascript/react-lifecycle-methods/) to understand the lifecycle methods that are more commonly used over others.
