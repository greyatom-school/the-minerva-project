# Controlled vs uncontrolled elements

## Overview

React differs from traditional JavaScript when it comes to handling form data. To maintain data binding, React uses a concept called controlled elements. We can also use uncontrolled components, but controlled components are highly recommended. 

In this topic, we will learn what controlled and uncontrolled elements are and what's the difference between them.

## Learning Outcome

-	What are the different ways to create form elements in React?
-	What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled elements?
-	How do we achieve data binding by using controlled form elements?

## Introduction


The simple difference between the two is that in controlled components, form data is handled by React while in the latter, the data is handled by DOM itself.
