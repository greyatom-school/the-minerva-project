# Components and their types

## Overview

In this topic, we will learn about one of the most basic and exciting features of React – Components. 

A component is very similar to functions that you might have studied in JavaScript in Sprint 3. It helps write resuable code.

We will also learn about imports and exports in React.

In this topic, we will also start our first step in building 'My Burger' project by using 'Create React App'(learned in the previous topic) and 'Components'

## Learning Outcome

-	What are components?
-	What are the different types of components?
-	What are imports and exports in React?


## Introduction

*Components*

To explain the concept of components, let's consider the example of a section showing mobile phones on an e-commerce website like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=mobile+phone&i=electronics&crid=1H461U1WKC2OH&sprefix=Mobile%2Caps%2C259&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_2_6).

If you observe closely, all the individual sections/cards showing a particular phone, as shown in the screen-grab below, have the same look and structure. On the extreme left, every card has an image. On the right, all the cards have a title, a rating section, price and delivery date. 

Now, imagine the number of such cards having the same structure you will need to create for a website like Amazon. The number could easily cross thousands, if not millions! If you had to manually create exactly same elements but with different content, it would not just be a waste of time, but also code and your application will pack in unnecessary more space than required!

This is where components come into picture. Components allow you to create the basic structure once and re-use that structure as many times as you want.

Components come in two flavors/varieties -

- **Functional components** - Ones which are structured as functions which accept arguments and return a React element.
- **Class-based components** - Ones which are structured as classes, which also return a React element.

However, apart from the structure, these two components also possess certain properties which you will learn by reading the links below.



## What you must do?

-	[Understand in depth about the components and props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) from the guided section in React documentation.

- Watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGgPINlKqBs) to understand the difference between the two better.

*Imports and exports in React*

When you create an app using create-react-app taught in the previous session, you will see a file called App.js which looks something like this:

![](https://github.com/greyatom-school/the-minerva-project/raw/master/FEWD/sprint_4/images/component.png)
 

With a basic knowledge and a fair idea about JSX, you can understand that the function App returns a JSX which would create the said elements on the web page. You need not pay attention to the code inside the div with a class called App. (Note: In React, the traditional attribute called class is replaced with className. It performs the exact same functionality as class and the only difference is in the spelling. So, whenever you need to add a class to an element in React, you should use className).

What we really need to look here is the import at the top and the export at the bottom. The import, as you might have read in JavaScript, is used to import modules, named parameters and in our case, components. Similarly, you need to export a component for it to be available to be used in other components, thereby completing reusability. Most of the times, we use `export default <component_name>` to export a component. We try to maintain logic by only including one component per JavaScript file and export it default.

## Coding Practice

Now that you have a clear idea about components, let's  start making 'Build My Burger App' (using create-react-app).

Following is screen we are aiming for after finishing this coding task:

![](https://github.com/greyatom-school/the-minerva-project/raw/master/FEWD/sprint_4/images/BMBT1.PNG)

The must have features for the webpapp are:

a)	A navigation header with the name 'Build My Burger'

b)	An empty central body with width 300px which will have a static text ‘My burger will be shown here’. (We will later convert this into a dynamic element using CSS)

c)	A container containing four options ‘Cheese’, ‘Meat’, ‘Veg Patty’, and ‘Salad’. 

d)	A footer with a button called ‘Order Now’.


To achieve that, complete the following tasks:


1. Create a new folder on your machine and using create-react-app, make a webpage. 

2.	Create a container component ‘MyBurger’ on a notepad or any text application which has the elements mentioned above.

3.	When you create a folder using create-react-app, your folder structure will look something like this:

![](https://github.com/greyatom-school/the-minerva-project/raw/master/FEWD/sprint_4/images/component_2.png) 

In the src folder, create a folder called components and a folder called pages. In the pages folder, we will add files which are basically containers for an entire page. In the component folder, we will add the rest of the files. With that logic, add MyBurger component to the pages folder. Make sure you are using export default to all the components.


3.	In the App.js file, delete everything inside the class App. Next, import your MyBurger component in App.js file. Remember `./` signifies the current folder and `./../` signifies the parent folder and so on.  


4.	Next, create a folder called ‘Ingredients’ in the components folder. 

---
*Q: Why did we create a folder? Any guesses?* 

Ans: We create a folder to house the JS file which will make the component and the CSS file which will give that component its personal style. Both the JS file and the CSS file will be given the same name Ingredients. 

----

So, to sum it up, we have a structure which looks like this:
src
- components
   - Ingredients
      - Ingredients.js
      - Ingredients.css


5.	Create the component ‘Ingredients’ in the JS file which we just created. The Ingredients component takes a name as prop and returns a div with the name. For the time being, leave the CSS file as is, we will touch that later.

6.	Import this component ‘Ingredients’ to ‘MyBurger’ as per option (c) of requirements above. Basically, call the Ingredients component thrice with the four options. 




You should now able to see your 'MyBurger' page on the browser.
