# Conditional rendering and rendering lists in React

## Overview


In this topic, we will learn two more important things about rendering in React:

- How to render components based on a condition 

- How to render lists and multiple components.


We will then use that knowledge to conditionally render components(alert box) for 'Build My Burger App' and render the ingredients in a list.

## Learning Outcome

In order to fully grasp the concepts in this session, it’s very crucial for you to have a good understanding of ES6 concepts such as map, filter and reduce. If you need to go through it again, read the ES6 concepts taught in sprint 3.

-	How to conditionally render components in React?

-	How to render lists in React?
-	How to render multiple components in React?
-	What is key and why is it important to include key while rendering lists?


## Introduction

Similar to JavaScript or jQuery, we can use conditions like if…else and for loops to render elements. We can also use conditional statements to prevent an element from rendering. 


## What must you do?

•	Read and understand how to perform [Conditional Rendering in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

•	[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o5FPaVA9m0) perfectly explains the conditional rendering in React.

## Coding Practice

In this practice, first we will learn how to create a modal using React. 


If you don’t know what a modal is, it looks like an alert box. Click [here](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp) to see what it looks like.

After we learn how to create a modal, we will use conditional rendering to show the modal. We will then use the principles you learnt in this topic to render the ingredients as a list.

For creating a modal, perform the following steps:

1.	Similar to what we were doing so far, create a folder called Backdrop in the component folder which will have two files – Backdrop.js and Backdrop.css. The Backdrop.js will house our component for creating the translucent grey background you see behind a modal. The only job of this component will be to return a div. 
 
2.	Now, add styling to this component. We will learn styling in detail in the next sprint using a fantastic thing called as CSS modules. However, in this session, we will add styles similar to inline styling we do in normal HTML. The only difference is that in React, you cannot use hyphens.

So, in the div that you have created in the Backdrop file, add a style attribute and add the following object in the style attribute:

`{{'width':'100%', 'height': '100%', 'backgroundColor': 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)', 'zIndex': 100, 'position':'fixed','left': 0,'top': 0}}.`

Now, you should have noticed two things:

a.	There are two curly braces.

b.	There seems to be syntactical changes. For example, background-color is backgroundColor.

As you might be aware, curly braces are special syntax to let the JSX parser know that it needs to interpret the contents in between {} as JavaScript instead of string. Hence, the outer braces. The inner braces are because the style attribute expects an object. As for (b), camel-casing is used in the inline styles to maintain consistency with JavaScript to access properties on DOM.

3.	Next, create another folder called Modal in the component folder. In this folder, add the two files Modal.js and Modal.css. In the Modal component, return a div which has two children – the Backdrop component you created in the previous point and another div which contains a h1 called Modal.

4.	Similar to step 2, add the styling to the Modal file as follows:

`{{height: ‘200px’, textAlign: ‘center’, position: ‘fixed’, backgroundColor: ‘#fff’, zIndex: 500, left: ‘15%’, top: ‘10%’, boxSizing: ‘border-box’, width: ‘70%’}}`

5.	In the MyBurger component, import this Modal component and add it to the render.

---
Now that you have created the Modal, complete the following tasks:
1.	Use conditional rendering to show the modal only when the user clicks ‘Order Now’ button.

2.	Use the concept of rendering lists to create the four Ingredients component.  (Hint: You can store the ingredients in the state and render it as a list using map.)

3.	Reconstruct the Modal to have a title `Your Order`. Using props, pass the current counters of every ingredient to the Modal and print them.
