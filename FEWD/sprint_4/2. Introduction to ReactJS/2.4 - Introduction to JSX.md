# Introduction to JSX

## Overview

In the previous topic, we learned that ReactJS extensively uses JSX for coding.


In fact one of the most important features of ReactJS is its usage of JSX – a syntactical extension to JavaScript. 

In this concept, we will understand what is JSX and how to write code in JSX.

## Learning Outcome
-	What is JSX?

-	Why do we use JSX in ReactJS?

-	What is the difference between JSX, JavaScript and HTML?


## Introduction

To explain JSX in layman terms, it allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in DOM withou using React's ```createElement()``` methods. In face, JSX converts the HTML tags into React elements without the need for invoking React's default methods.

While using JSX is not a mandate, it can save a plethora of time and coding, thanks to its similarity to the HTML structure.

## What you must do?

-	Go through the official React documentation and familiarise yourself with [JSX and its syntax](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
