## Key take-aways

- You have a clear understanding of setting the layout in Bootstrap.
- You know how to use bootstrap components.
- You can override default bootstrap style if necessary.
- You learnt how to use bootstrap utilities.

## How will it help the project?

You have learnt how to make the site responsive and have seen the extensive list of components that bootstrap provides. You'd be using bootstrap to set the layout of some sections of the final project (Zomato Landing Page) by using Bootstrap grid layout system, use the button, input and dropdown components to render form elements of the website and use certain utility classes for aligning certain elements (center-align, column layout, etc).

With this unit, we conclude Sprint 2. We hope you enjoyed making the sites responsive. As a frontend developer, you are expected to know Responsive web design as these days, rarely there are sites that aren't responsive.
