## Overview

In this section, we will learn about Bootstrap Component and Utilities that helps us in rendering few commonly used UI elements and style our UI elements efficiently and consistently.

Though, you won't be using all the components for the stack overflow project, you would be using a few in the final project (Zomato landing page). In our stack overflow project, try using the button and card components or try to fit it in areas you deem to be appropriate. Below, we have provided a represetation of what can be achieved:

## Learning Outcome

- What are the commonly used UI elements available with Bootstrap Components?
- What are the commonly used style classes available with Bootstrap Utilities?

### Bootstrap Components and Utilities

The Bootstrap documentation, has a very large “[Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/)” section that includes most of the stylized CSS Components. These are the commonly used UI elements that developers and designers usually use while building web sites or apps.

Bootstrap 4 has a lot of **utility/helper** classes to quickly style elements without using any CSS code.

#### What you must do?

- Go through the list of [available Bootstrap 4 components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/). You don't really have to mug up the syntax or class names. You can keep revisiting and copy the syntax while using in your projects. But, you should be aware of the available components.

- Go through the list of [available Bootstrap 4 utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/utilities/borders/). As mentioned earlier, mug up all the class names but be aware of what's available in the list of utilities.

- In case, you still have trouble understanding bootstrap, go through the entire [bootstrap tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRtjMdoYXLf47brThg9-nTj8HSq8cQ0ND)
