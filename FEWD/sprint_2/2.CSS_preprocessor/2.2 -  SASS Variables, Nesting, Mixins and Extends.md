## Overview

From this section will learn about the SASS features that we would use in our projects.

You would use variables for saving colors used in the stack overflow site to be reused later, nesting css classes, mixins and extends. You should be able to achieve the below shown section:

## Learning Outcome

- What are SASS Variables and how to use them?
- What is SASS Nesting?
- What are mixins in sass?
- What does the extends keyword do in SASS?

### SASS Features: Variables, Nesting, Modules and Partials

**SASS Variables** are a way to store information that you can re-use later. With Sass, you can store information in variables, like:

- strings
- numbers
- colors
- booleans
- lists
- nulls

Sass uses the \$ symbol, followed by a name, to declare variables:

`$_variablename_: _value_;`

<hr>
**Nesting** allows you to write selectors that mimic the structure of your HTML. This allows you to use shortcuts to create your CSS. For example:

```sass
div {
    p {
        color: black;
    }
}
```

When you are just starting out using Sass one of the first features you will hear about is nesting. One reason we may use a preprocessor is to lessen the amount of typing we need to create CSS rules. Nesting allows us to use shortcuts to create our rules. The problem with all great tools is that the potential for misuse is always there. Nesting is no different as overuse can create complex, unmanageable stylesheets.

<hr>
**Sass Mixins** facilitates you to make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse repeatedly on your site. You can even pass the value according to your need to make the mixin more flexible.

The mixin can store multiple values or parameters and call function to avoid writing repetitive codes. Mixin names can use underscores and hyphens interchangeably.

<hr>

**SASS Extend** can be explained better with a code snippet.

SASS code:

```sass
.awesome {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}

body {
    @extend .awesome;
}
p {
    @extend .awesome;
}

```

Result:

```sass
.awesome, body, p {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}

```

You can't pass parameters during the extending, but that's not the idea actually. @extend should be used in those places where you want to share properties between the elements.

If you do not want `.awesome` class your final _.css_ file then to achieve this you could use [Pplaceholder selectors](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/placeholder-selectors).

#### What you must do?

- Read about the [purpose and usage of SASS variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables)

- Read about [SASS selectors and selector nesting](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules). You can skip the part about interpolation. Pick it up after you read about mixins

- One of the powerful features of SASS is mixins which helps in code reusability and helps you in being efficient while writing css. Read about [SASS Mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin)

- Extends helps with code reusability too but instead of writing it in a functional pattern, it helps you with copying properties of an existing rule and applying it to the current rule. Read about [SASS Extend](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/extend)

### Summary

Weâ€™ve taken a fairly in-depth look at the core foundational concepts of Sass. This forms the basis of any SASS project.

Do not nest selectors after one or 2 levels. Nesting more than 2 levels compromises code readability.

Use @extend to reuse the CSS as much as possible.

Create mixins to reuse CSS with dynamic values by passing these values to the parameter.
