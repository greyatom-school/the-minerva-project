## Overview

In this section, we will learn about the SASS Flow control, modules and partials.

You'll end up writing css as if it's a programming language. You will import another css file (e.g maybe you wrote common css for the whole site). Below code blocks would help you visualize better:

- What is SASS Flow control?
- What are modules in sass?
- What are SASS Partials?

### SASS Features: Flow control, Modules and Partials

One of the ways CSS can be limiting is the lack of conditional logic and loops. You’re limited in your ability to set a style if one condition is true or while another remains true. There are media queries which offer some conditional logic, but odds are you’ve wished you could test against more conditions than media queries allow.

One of the reasons people choose preprocessors like Sass is because they offer conditional logic and looping mechanisms as control structures.

One of the most popular Sass features is the ability to split your  CSS  code into multiple smaller files, and then merge them back together into a single (often minified)  CSS  document for the browser.

As our projects get bigger, that becomes even more important – but the relationships between files can also get blurry or confusing. We might see a variable, and not know where it was defined, then search through our files and find several definitions. **Modules** are meant to clarify those relationships, both for us as developers and for the compiler. Every file is a “module”, and everything in that module is explicitly defined – including dependencies.

A **partial** is any file with an underscore `_` preceding the name. When Sass sees these files, it will not process them into CSS files. A partial requires that it be imported into another file that will inevitability be processed into CSS in order for it to be output.

#### What you must do?

- [Read about the purpose and usage of SASS Flow control](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control)
- Modules are used load the content of another SASS stylesheet in the current stylesheet. This helps in organizing stylesheet in a convenient way rather than writing all the CSS in a single file. [Please go through the post to learn how you can take advantage of SASS modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use)
- [A partial is simply an **Sass** file preceded by an underscore.](https://www.quackit.com/sass/tutorial/sass_partials.cfm). An example is \_name-of-file.**scss** . The underscore tells **Sass** that the file is a partial and that it should not be compiled to CSS. This partial can then be imported into another file that will be compiled to CSS.

### Summary

SASS Flow controls adds logical and iterative power like any other programming language while writing CSS.

SASS Modules and partials are quite helpful in setting up the architecture of your project.
