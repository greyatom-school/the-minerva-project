## What did you learn?

Now, you have a good understanding of Responsive web design.
At the end of this concept, you should have an understanding of how to create a responsive web page using html and css. You have started creating the StackOverflow landing page which we'll continue further along the course.

## Key take-aways

- You have a clear understanding of why responsive web design came into existence and how quickly we can render our website on multiple devices rather than building a separate website for specific device group.
- You have learnt the basic building blocks of responsive web design
- You can create a responsive web page using media queries and breakpoints
- You learnt the basics of grid layout system
- You learnt how to make images and texts responsive.

## How will it help the project?

You have learnt how to make the site responsive. You'd be using media queries with breakpoints to make the site responsive so that site renders as per the device screen size and creating classes for setting up the grid layout to build the final project (Zomato Landing Page). The final project consists of images and text and you have learnt how to make them responsive too.

Next, you'd learn how to use CSS pre-processors which would help you in writing CSS programmatically (you would be able to use if/else, variables, etc.) and provides us with more features to help write maintainable CSS. By the end of the unit, you should be able to achieve the UI shown in the below given image:
