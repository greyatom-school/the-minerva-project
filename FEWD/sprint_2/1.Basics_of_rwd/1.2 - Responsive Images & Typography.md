## Overview

This section will teach you how to render images and text responsively.

At the end of this concept, you'd have placed the images within a container and it'd resize based on the device. The web is incomplete without texts. You'd also learn how to make the texts flow responsively. You should be able to achieve the below given UI:

## Learning Outcome

- How to style images to be responsive on the web?
- How to render responsive texts?

### Responsive Images and Text

Mobile users often pay for every byte they download (and upload) away from wifi. HTML and CSS files, while getting larger every year, aren’t as large as hefty JPG, PNGs and animated GIFs. Conscientious designers know that best practice includes making websites and apps that download as quickly as possible. It’s like trimming out extra adverbs from copy, or extra div elements from markup.

If users don’t need pixels, don’t send them.

As we’ve seen, thinking “responsive” is more than slapping media queries into our code. Responsive images have their own set of challenges. To make sites that work well and look great on a variety of screens, they need a smart strategy for images from the beginning.

Difficult? Perhaps. Worth the effort? Yes. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but if it weighs a million bytes, then users may give up before the picture downloads.

**Typography** for multiple screens is no mean feat. There are three things we need to do from a design perspective.

First, the distance between a user's eyes and their screen depends on what kind of device they're using. Generally, the user will place the device further away when using a larger screen. This phenomenon means you need to increase your font sizes as the device width increases.

Second, we want to keep the proportions between the body text and other elements consistent. This means we have to increase the sizes of all elements as we increase the body text size.

Third, at specific breakpoints we want to increase the **font-size** of specific elements (like the h1) by picking a different number from the modular scale. Doing so allows us to control the visual hierarchy and ensures that elements garner just enough attention to pull a user to read on.

#### What you must do?

- An important aspect of making an image responsive and fluid to adjust to various screen sizes, [learn how to do it](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_responsive.asp). Not that this might not always work for all screen sizes. Sometimes you might have to handle the image resizing using media queries by playing with the image or it's parent element (e.g div) width and height.

It also let's know how you can handle fluid typography using SASS. You don't have to go through that section yet but if you are interested, you can revisit it once you lear about CSS pre-processors.

### Summary

Sites are usually made of images and texts. It's very important for you to understand how can make texts and images scale to various screen sizes. Even our assignments and project has taken this into consideration and you would have to apply what you learnt to make texts and images responsive.
