### Responsive Media queries and breakpoints

[Media queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/) give us a very powerful way to adjust our styles according to factors like the type of device used, the viewport size, the screen’s pixel density, or even the device orientation. They are used to customize the appearance of a website on multiple devices. A media query consist of a media type that can contain one or more expression which can be either true or false. The result of the query is true if the specified media matches the type of device the document is displayed on. If the media query is true then the style sheet is applied.

**Breakpoints** are the point at which your sites content layout will change to provide the user with the best possible layout depending on the device. For example, on mobile phones with smaller screens you would have a smaller navigation bar on top of the screen than if someone opens the same website on computer with 27″ monitor.
