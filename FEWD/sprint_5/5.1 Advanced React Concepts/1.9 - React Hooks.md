# **React Hooks**

## Overview

In this session, we will learn about one of the latest and most important features in React called Hooks.


## Learning Outcome

•	What are React Hooks and why were they introduced?

•	What problems are potentially solved by React Hooks?

•	How to use Hooks?

•	What are the rules of Hooks?

•	How to build your own Hook?


## React Hooks

Hooks are the latest addition in React 16.8. In simple terms, React Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

## What you must do?

To understand React Hooks more clearly, it’s very crucial to code while understanding the concept.

•	First and foremost, we need to understand the need for introducing Hooks. Read the section titled **Motivation** [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

•	Next up, read these three sections from the co-founder of Redux and CRA, Dan Abramov’s [article on Medium on Hooks](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889) – **Why Hooks?**, **Do Hooks make React bloated?**, and **What are Hooks, exactly?** You can continue reading the further sections as well, but they will be targeted in the coming points.

•	Next, read the **No Breaking Changes** section [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) before we move on to understanding how to write Hooks.

•	Now that we have a basic understanding of what a React Hook is, let’s dive into the coding of React Hook. First, we will look at incorporating state in Hooks. Read [this section](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) completely to understand the concept. Please ensure you also code while reading this. To have a better grasp of the concept, initially create the code using classes and then move on to functions. 

•	Next, we will check out the effects of Hook. This is akin to the componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate you might have used in stateful components. Read [this](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) to understand the concept. As with the previous point, you need to code while reading and also try to code in both stateful component and function components.

•	Now, read the rules of Hooks [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html). 

•	Finally, read about how to build your own Hooks [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html). 



•	[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM&feature=youtu.be) by Dan Abramov gives a wonderful understanding of React with Hooks.

## Additional Resources

•	For Hooks API reference which includes all the Hooks you have seen so far along with a few more additional hooks that you can use, as well, read [this](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html).

• ```useState``` and ```useEffect``` are the two hooks that you will be using more frequently. Here is a detailed explanation of [useState](https://blog.logrocket.com/a-guide-to-usestate-in-react-ecb9952e406c/) and [useEffect](https://daveceddia.com/useeffect-hook-examples/).
