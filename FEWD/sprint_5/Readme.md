# Concept 5: Advanced React

## Introduction

The previous concept introduced you to the world of ReactJS – a world replete with reusable components, simplified coding and unbelievable rendering performances. In this concept, we will deep-dive into the advanced concepts of React. At the end of this sprint, you will be well-versed with concepts like refs, fragments, HOCs, error boundaries and much more. You will also learn how to achieve the feeling of a multi-page application in React using routing.


## Learning Objectives

In this sprint, we will be learning about some advanced concepts of React. To be able to comprehend these concepts, you need to have a complete understanding of the following topics:

•       What is ReactJS and how does it make web development more efficient?

•       What are components and what are the different types of components?

•       What are state and props in React?

•       How are events handled in React?

•       How to render lists in React? 

•       How to connect the React application to back-end?

•       What is create-react-app and how does it aid developers in coding?

If you are still not comfortable with these concepts, I would recommend you read through Sprint 4 again to understand these concepts before we move ahead.

At the end of this sprint, you will learn the following:

•	How to create React applications which can be used by every type of user, irrespective of the language spoken, machine, accessories or disability?

•	How to handle errors in React?

•	What are fragments and HOCs and how do they resolve the problem of not returning adjacent DOM element inside the render method in React?

•	How to pass components in a multi-level hierarchical React application?

•	How to make a stateless component use the properties of state and why is it needed?

•	How to dynamically style React components?

•	How to achieve routing within a React application?



## What will you be building?


- 'My Burger' Project

As part of coding assessment, you will also be modifying your 'Build my Burger' app using the new concepts you will learn in this sprint.

- 'Weather Application'

You will also be creating a new application - A Weather Application as part of your coding assessment

- 'Home' page

- 'My Cities' page

![](https://github.com/greyatom-school/the-minerva-project/raw/master/FEWD/sprint_5/images/assignment_532b.PNG) 



In this app, we will be using [Open Weather's](https://openweathermap.org/api) APIs for fetching the weather data for different cities **in India**.  We will also be saving the weather information and displaying weather information of cities of our choice.
