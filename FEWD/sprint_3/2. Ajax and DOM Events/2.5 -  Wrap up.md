- You have learnt the basics of events, event loop and event delegation


## How will it help the project?

Since, you have learnt the basics of AJAX and jQuery, you can use it for fetchinng the data from the news API using either fetch or jQuery AJAX. You can use lodash to manipulate the result retrieved from the API.

Next, you'd learn some of the advanced concepts of JavaScript.
