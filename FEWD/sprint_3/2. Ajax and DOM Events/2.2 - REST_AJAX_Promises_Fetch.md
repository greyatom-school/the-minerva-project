## Overview

This concept will help you understand AJAX.

At the ed of this section, you would be able to make API calls using the built-in fetch API. Fetch quiz details from [opentdb api](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=11&difficulty=easy&type=multiple). Iterate through them and render them on the web page using DOM manipulation techniques. Use jQuery for DOM manipulation. Create a pop up to accept username.

We have attached an image for reference:

## Learning Outcome

- What is AJAX?
- What purpose does AJAX serve?
- What is REST?
- What is the Fetch API?

### REST

REST stands for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer.

It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will _transfer_ to the client a _representation_ of the _state_ of the requested resource.

For example, when a developer calls Instagram API to fetch a specific user (the resource), the API will return the state of that user, including their name, the number of posts that user posted on Instagram so far, how many followers they have, and more.

The representation of the state can be in a JSON format, and probably for most APIs this is indeed the case. It can also be in XML, HTML format or based on what the user wants to request from the server.

#### What you must do?

- Understand [how HTTP requests work](https://flaviocopes.com/http-request/) In this post, analyze what happens when you type an URL in the address bar of your browser and press enter.
- The Status-Code element in a server response, is a 3-digit integer where the first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit: An important list of [the HTTP request status code](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_status_codes.htm)

### AJAX & Promises

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a mechanism through which web applications can send and retrieve data from a [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server") asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON "JSON") instead of XML.

#### What you must do?

- As discussed, understand [what is AJAX?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ajax-introduction/) The following tutorial will provide a short introduction to Ajax and its uses.
- The way developers talk to a server is via API calls. One of the common response that's sent via the server is the JSON response. Watch this tutorial that covers [JSON and making calls to retrieve JSON via AJAX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI1CWzNtE-M)

- Read and practice [AJAX in real time](https://gomakethings.com/ajax-and-apis-with-vanilla-javascript/)
- In order to understand what promises are and what need they meet, we shall first consider the world before promises. Read about [JS Promises](https://www.macadamian.com/learn/javascript-promises-explained/)

### Fetch API

`fetch()` allows you to make network requests similar to XMLHttpRequest (XHR). The main difference is that the Fetch API uses Promises, which enables a simpler and cleaner API, avoiding callback hell and having to remember the complex API of XMLHttpRequest.

#### What you must do?

- We need to learn the Fetch API basics and learn to perform HTTP GET and POST requests with that API by implementing practical examples. Learn how to utilize [`fetch()` API for promised based data fetching in plain javascript](https://codingthesmartway.com/fetch-api-introduction-to-promised-based-data-fetching-in-plain-javascript/)
- Watch and learn from this ene to end tutorial on [how to make REST API calls with examples using fetch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oive66jrwBs&t=118s)

## Coding Practice

### Task

In your code, make an api call to [opentdb.com](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=11&difficulty=easy&type=multiple)

The API provides you with the dummy data of quiz questions and answers.
