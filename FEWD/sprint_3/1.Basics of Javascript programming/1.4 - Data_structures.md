## Overview

This concept will help you understand Data structures in JS.

Data structure plays a very important role in building the architecture of an application. Many companies are very particular about making sure the developers they hire have a solid understanding of data structure.

## Learning Outcome

- What is a data structure?
- Why do we need to structure the data?

### Data structrure

A **data structure** is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Data structures are the way we are able to store and retrieve data.

#### What you must do?

- Read about various [native JS array methods](http://www.java2s.com/Tutorials/Javascript/Javascript_Data_Structure/0300__Javascript_Array_Iterator.htm) used for manipulating and accessing data. They play a vital role in handling data structures
- Read about [shallow and deep copy of the data in JavaScript](http://www.java2s.com/Tutorials/Javascript/Javascript_Data_Structure/0240__Javascript_Array_Aggregate.htm)
- Learn how you can [search, append and convert an array](http://www.java2s.com/Tutorials/Javascript/Javascript_Data_Structure/0260__Javascript_Array_Access.htm) of values in JavaScript
- Learn how to [manipulate arrays](http://www.java2s.com/Tutorials/Javascript/Javascript_Data_Structure/0280__Javascript_Array_Modifier.htm) in JavaScript.
- Organize and access [multidimensional arrays](http://www.java2s.com/Tutorials/Javascript/Javascript_Data_Structure/0320__Javascript_Multidimensional_Array.htm)
- In JS, you can store objects in array and vice versa. [This tutorial](http://www.java2s.com/Tutorials/Javascript/Javascript_Data_Structure/0330__Javascript_Arrays_Objects.htm) will teach you how to access objects stored in array.

- Watch and learn [how to use arrays and looping through them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orAS-MBh5f4) which you would be doing extensively while working in the industry.

This below given links will help you in understanding the logic behind structuring data using various algorithms. Data structures have recently gained a lot of attention in the frontend world. Also, if you are planning to appear for an interview, you'll probably face questions related to data structure. Though you'd hardly be using these algorithms, it's still a good practice to learn and understand these algorithms.
