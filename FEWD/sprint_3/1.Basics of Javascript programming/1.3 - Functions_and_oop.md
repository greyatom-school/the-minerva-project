## Overview

This concept will help you understand Functions and Object-oriented programming in JS.

At the end, you would have a solid understanding of how to declare and define functions and how to introduce modularization by reusing properties and methods in oops. Create a variable with object which has a property name. Create a function that accepts object as a parameter. Pass the variable you created for storing the object as parameter to the function. The function should return the value from the property name.

## Learning Outcome

- What is a function?
- When and why should we use function?
- What is Object oriented programming (OOP) in JS?
- When should we opt for OOP?
- How does it help in structuring our data?

### Functions

A **function** is a block of code that performs an action or returns a value. Functions are custom code defined by programmers that are reusable, and can therefore make your programs more modular and efficient.

#### What you must do?

- Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script. For example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else.Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition. Read about the [basics of JS Functions](https://javascript.info/function-basics)
- Closures allow JavaScript programmers to write better code. Creative, expressive, and concise. We frequently use closures in JavaScript, and, no matter your JavaScript experience, you will undoubtedly encounter them time and again. Sure, closures might appear complex and beyond your scope, but after you read this article, closures will be much more easily understood and thus more appealing for your everyday JavaScript programming tasks. Read and understand [JS closures](https://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/)
- In JavaScript, you can call a function, as soon as you create it. Read about them i.e. [Immediately Invoked Function expressions](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-iife/)
- In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects; that is, functions are of the type Object and they can be used in a first-class manner like any other object (String, Array, Number, etc.) since they are in fact objects themselves. They can be “stored in variables, passed as arguments to functions, created within functions, and returned from functions”.

- Read about the [execution context and stack](http://davidshariff.com/blog/what-is-the-execution-context-in-javascript/)
- Additionally you can go through [this playlist that covers function extensively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6QaDqud66Y&list=PLyuRouwmQCjm_RIe2_W4-7cqD_5C_zqVu).

### Object-oriented programming

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to using self-contained pieces of code to develop applications. We call these self-contained pieces of code **objects**, better known as _Classes_ in most OOP programming languages and _Functions_ in JavaScript. We use objects as building blocks for our applications. Building applications with objects allows us to adopt some valuable techniques, namely, **Inheritance** (objects can inherit features from other objects), **Polymorphism** (objects can share the same interface—how they are accessed and used—while their underlying implementation of the interface may differ), and **Encapsulation** (each object is responsible for specific tasks). Objects and functions are useful for modelling our data and writing reusable code.
