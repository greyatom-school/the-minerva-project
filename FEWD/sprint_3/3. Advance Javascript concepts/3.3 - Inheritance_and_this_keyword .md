## Overview

This concept will help you understand Inheritance in JS and the infamous `this` keyword.

After covering this topic, you would be able to create classes and inherit properties and methods of other classes.

## Learning Outcome

- How does Inheritance work in JS?
- What does the 'this' keyword do?

### Inheritance in JS

Inheritance is an important concept in object oriented programming. In the classical inheritance, methods from base class get copied into derived class.

In JavaScript, inheritance is supported by using prototype object. Some people call it "Prototypal Inheritance" and some people call it "Behaviour Delegation".

#### What you must do?

- Watch this walkthrough video that covers [inheritance extensively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkFlM73G-hk&list=PLoYCgNOIyGABs-wDaaxChu82q_xQgUb4f). Please go through all the videos to understand inheritance and the modular approach we take while building applications for our clients.

- Class inheritance is a way for one class to extend another class.
  So we can create new functionality on top of the existing. Go through the article to understand [JS inheritance](https://javascript.info/class-inheritance)

## Coding Practice

### Task 1

- Create a class `Vehicle`. The constructor accepts 3 parameters i.e make (e.g toyota), model (e.g corolla) and color (e.g black). Create a method called `getName` within the class. Calling this method would return the make, model and color of the vehicle.

### Task 2

- Create another class that would inherit the properties of Vehicle class and add a method to `console.log()` the results of `getName`. Create a instance of the 2nd class and display results in the console.
