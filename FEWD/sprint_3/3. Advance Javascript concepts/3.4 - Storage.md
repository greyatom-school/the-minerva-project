## Overview

This concept will help you understand Web Storage and available options.

At the end of this topic, you'd be able to store data that you might wanna show the user when he return or maybe save some common config of the specific user. It has an array of use cases.

Store the username of the quiz app in the storage and don't ask for the name again if it exists in the local storage.

## Learning Outcome

- What is web storage?
- What options are available for storage?
- Why do we need web storage?

### Storage

**Web storage**, sometimes known as **DOM storage**, provides web apps with methods and protocols for storing client-side data. Web storage supports persistent data storage with a greatly enhanced capacity. There are two main web storage types: local storage and session storage. We can also use cookies to store information although cookies store very small amount of data. All major browsers support it.

#### What you must do?

- Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.
  When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page are added to the request. This way the server gets the necessary data to "remember" information about users. What are [Cookies](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp)?
  
- With web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser. Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server. Web storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data. A short guide to [Web storage](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp)
