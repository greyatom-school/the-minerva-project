## Overview

This concept will help you understand ECMAScript 6 i.e the stable newer version of JavaScript.

Once you cover this topic, try rewriting the quiz app code in ES6.

## Learning Outcome

- What is ECMAScript 6 (ES6)?
- Why should one learn ES6?
- What are the new features that ES6 provides?

### ECMAScript 6

ECMA stand for **European Computer Manufacturer Association**. ECMA is the association that puts out the guidelines for JavaScript in all browsers. I will cover the history of Javascript and creation of ECMA before I go into detail on ES6 features .

#### History

- 1995 — Javascript was created.
- 1997 — ECMAScript 1
- ECMAScript 2–3 are aboned within a few years after ES1, not as important since ES5 eclipsed the other version.
- ES4 — abandoned.
- 2009 — ES5 is released. Brought forEach, map, and filter to JS.
- 2015 — ES6 specs are released

In short, ECMA(Script) is the association that provides the guidelines for what all browsers should support as well as provide new features that are available in JavaScript.

**NOTE**: just because new guidelines are released it does not mean that all browsers support the new features released. [**_Compatibility Click Here._**](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)

#### Transpiling with Babel

Since not all browsers support ES6 you may need to transpile your code from ES6 to ES5 so your code will be read by more browsers. Transpiling is also used for CoffeeScript and TypeScript.

Babel does the transpiling in order for your browser to render appropriately. Babel is the most popular transpiler since it supports the most amount of browsers.

- Babel was created by Sebastian Mckenzie (worked at fb).
- Babel is frequently used with React which was developed by FaceBook.

#### What you must do?

- Install Node.js that's compatible with your operating system [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- **Babel** is a transpiler that converts latest versions of JavaScript to browser or system compatible JavaScript. Browsers and platforms that rely on JS cannot swiftly change to newer versions as sites and app might not be compatible with the newer versions. Also, it's not easier for companies to quickly adopt to emerging technologies. Babel allows developers to write code using the latest JS syntax and babel handles that hassle of making it compatible for various platforms and systems.
- **Webpack** is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset (e.g css, html, image, font, etc).

  - Often we need to represent an idea or concept in our programs — maybe a car engine, a computer file, a router, or a temperature reading. Representing these concepts directly in code comes in two parts: data to represent the state, and functions to represent the behavior. ES6 classes give us a convenient syntax for defining the state and behavior of objects that will represent our concepts. [ES6 Classes](https://www.sitepoint.com/object-oriented-javascript-deep-dive-es6-classes/)
  - Creating a method also means writing an API — whether it’s for yourself, another developer on your team, or other developers using your project. Depending on the size, complexity, and purpose of your function, you have to think of default settings and the API of your input/output.

### ECMAScript 6 - Async / Await

The async function declaration defines an asynchronous function, which returns an AsyncFunction object.
When an async function is called, it returns a Promise.

When the async function returns a value, the Promise will be resolved with the returned value. When the async function throws an exception or some value, the Promise will be rejected with the thrown value.

An async function can contain an await expression, that pauses the execution of the async function and waits for the passed Promise's resolution, and then resumes the async function's execution and returns the resolved value.
