# **Jest and Enzyme**

## Overview

We will be using Test-Driven Developmemt for React and in this session, we will be learning the two important tools which will help us with TDD.

## Learning Outcomes

- What is Jest and Enzyme?
- How to use Jest and Enzyme to test our React applications?


## Jest and Enzyme

While BDD has its own benefits, as you might have seen in the previous session, we will be concentrating on the Test-Driven-Development for our React application.

For React applications, we typically use Jest and Enzyme for tests. 

## What you must do?

- [This article](https://pusher.com/tutorials/react-jest-enzyme) helps you understand how to test using Jest and Enzyme.

- This [article](https://dev.to/richardigbiriki/testing-your-first-react-component-with-jest-and-enzyme-p38) fantastically sums up an introduction to testing in React application.


## Additional Resources

- Check out [the offical React blog](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing-recipes.html) for understanding more about testing.

- This is [the official page of Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react) used for unit testing in React application.
- This is [another tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-jest-enzyme) on testing in React using Jest and Enzyme.


## Coding Assignment

Although we have created the entire 'Build My Burger' application by now, I'd like you to add Jest and Enzyme for testing a few components.

- Use Jest and Enzyme for adding tests for the ingredients components. Ensure that every ingredient should begin with counter 0. Additionally, add a test to check that if the user pressed <kbd>-</kbd> button when the counter is 0, it should not go to -1. Add a failing case to check first and then add a passing case.
- Similarly, add a test for Orders component where you test whether the user has filled the entire form before he submits.
