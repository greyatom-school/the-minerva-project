# **Understanding Redux flow**

## Overview

In this session, we will understand the flow of Redux applications.


## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this session, you will learn the following:

- What is the role of actions, reducers and store in Redux applications?
- What is the flow of code in a typical Redux application?
- How can we globally achieve a state management system using Redux?


## The Redux Flow

In the previous session, we looked at three components of Redux - **store**, **actions** and **reducers**. In this session, we will see how these three work in tandem.

The image above briefly explains the process of a typical redux application. Let's understand the above image's flow with an example. Let's imagine we have a file called ```Main.js``` which has a ```button```. On clicking the button, a ```Modal``` should open on the Main.js file.

Recreating the above application with Redux, we will begin by having two primary entities - the **Component** which has the button and **store** which houses the state. 
1. In our case, the state will be nothing more than a simple object key called ```showModal: false```, housed inside the **store**. 
2. On clicking the button, the component will now dispatch an action (only action holds the power to connect to a reducer). It will request the action to ask the reducer to change the state.
3. The action will now request the reducer to change the state.
4. Finally, the request sent from component reaches the store and it changes state to ```showModal: true```.
5. The **Component** has to subscribe to the store for any changes. The moment the state is changed to true, the subscribed component now receives a copy of the global state (similar to a rended function inside a component receiving state changes).
6. With the new state, the Component now shows the modal.
