# **Asynchronous actions in Redux**

## Overview

In this session, we will deal with async actions in Redux and we will be introducted to a concept called **Middleware**.

For example, in our 'Build My Burger' project,  we are updating the reducer state with data fetched from Firebase. Since Axios requests can be asynchronous, we need to handle these requests in a different way.

## Learning Outcomes

In this session, you will learn the following:

- How to handle asynchronous requests in Redux?
- What are Middlewares?
- What is Redux thunk?


## Middlewares and Redux Thunk

As we have seen in our project assignments, more often than not, we need to connect to the back-end to update our reducer state. In such cases, given that requests from back-end don't act in a synchronous fashion, we need to ensure that our reducer state is not corrupted. This is where **Middlewares** come into picture.

## What you must do?

- Read [this article](https://www.codementor.io/vkarpov/beginner-s-guide-to-redux-middleware-du107uyud) which will help you understand the need for Middleware in Redux with an example. 

- This is [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h892pHdLQtM) by Maxmillian which brilliantly explains the concept of asynchronous actions in Redux. Watch the entire video and practice on your local machine.

- Finally, look at [this article](https://alligator.io/redux/redux-thunk/) which explains using Redux-thunk in React applicaton.


## Coding Assignment

In the last session, we created multiple reducers are fetched the order data from the Firebase database.
In this session's assignemnt, we will use redux-thunk for async action to our Redux application.

You need to do the following tasks:

- Install redux-thunk to the application.
- Use Axios and redux-thunk to apply middleware to our application.

- Create a loader component.
- Using the middleware, add a loader component till we receive a response from the Axios request.


In the weather application that we created previously, we now need to add the MyCities page state to a different reducer.

- Using ```combineReducers```, add the two reducers and accordingly, access the state in the ```mapStateToProps```.

- Ensure the code doesn't break with two reducers.
