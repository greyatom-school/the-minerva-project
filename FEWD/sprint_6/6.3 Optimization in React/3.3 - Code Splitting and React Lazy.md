# **Code Splitting, React.lazy and Suspense**

## Overview

In this session, we will learn about three important concepts for web optimization in React - Code Splitting, React.lazy and Suspense.

This will help you not rely simply on keeping your bundle size smaller to make your app better.


## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this session, you will be able to

- Explore new ways of making your app load quicker.

- What is Code Splitting?
- What is React.lazy and Suspense?
- How to use these three to optimize your code?


## Code Splitting

In the previous session, we learnt a great deal about bundling and how it solves our JavaScript problems. However, while bundling may statically reduce our web application size, if we are including the third-party libraries, there is every bit of a chance that your bundle size will grow. In that case, what will we do?

## What you must do?

- Go through this article on [React's official documentation on Code Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html). It also touches base on React.lazy and Suspense.

- This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV9gvls8IP8) brilliantly describes Code Splitting, React Lazy and Suspense.

- This is [a detailed article](https://tylermcginnis.com/react-router-code-splitting/) on Code Splitting and React.lazy. It contains examples to learn the sessions.

## Coding Assignment

Use React's code splitting and the fellow concepts to introduce optimization in the Burger Builder app. 

- Components like PlaceOrder which are not loaded in the beginning should be loaded on request with React.lazy.
