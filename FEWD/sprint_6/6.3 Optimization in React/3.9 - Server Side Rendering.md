## Server Side Rendering (SSR)

We are well aware that React renders the application on the client-side. However, if we consider server-side rendering of the React application, a lot of avenues open up. 

Primarily, it will help with the performance. Secondly, it's a major benefit that the SPA will be rendered completely on the server and then sent to the client, thereby saving a lot of time on client-side application. And finally, it helps in having an app that can be crawled for content that generally non-JavaScript handlers cannot handle.
