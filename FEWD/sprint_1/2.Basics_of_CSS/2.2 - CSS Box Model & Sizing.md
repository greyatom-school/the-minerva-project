### What is CSS?

All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

### What you must do?

- The “CSS box model“ is a set of rules that define how every web page on the Internet is rendered. CSS treats each element in your HTML document as a “box” with a bunch of different properties that determine where it appears on the page [A complete guide to CSS Box Model](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-box-model/) or you can just [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIO5326FgPE) to code along and learn.

- Learn [CSS Dimension](https://codescracker.com/css/css-dimension.htm). Width and height are important properties that we use regularly while setting the boundaries of an element. Make sure you understand how it works well before proceeding.
- Learn about [margins and paddings](https://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/beginner/margins/). Please click on the links associated with margin and padding available on the page.
- You'll find numerous measurement units available in CSS. Though you might not use all of them, it's good to have an understanding of all the available units. [Go through the list of measurement units](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_measurement_units.htm)
- The top and bottom margins of blocks are sometimes combined (collapsed) into a single margin whose size is the largest of the individual margins (or just one of them, if they are equal), a behavior known as **margin collapsing**. Note that the margins of floating and absolutely positioned elements never collapse. [Read more about it](https://css-tricks.com/what-you-should-know-about-collapsing-margins/)
- Read about [CSS Borders](https://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/beginner/borders/) and it's variant. You can set the thickness and color as well.
