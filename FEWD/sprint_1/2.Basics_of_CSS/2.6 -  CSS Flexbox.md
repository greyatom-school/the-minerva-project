## Overview

In the previous section you learnt about postioning and layout. This section will introduce you to CSS Flexbox - a layout module.The “Flexible Box” or “Flexbox” layout mode offers an alternative to Floats for defining the overall appearance of a web page. Whereas floats only let us horizontally position our boxes, flexbox gives us _complete_ control over the alignment, direction, order, and size of our boxes.After end of this topic you will be able to do this.

### CSS Flexbox

The web is currently undergoing a major transition, so a little discussion around the state of the industry is warranted. For the last decade or so, floats were the sole option for laying out a complex web page. As a result, they’re well supported even in legacy browsers, and developers have used them to build millions of web pages. This means you’ll inevitably run into floats during your web development career. So, learning about floats wasn't a complete waste

However, floats were originally intended for the magazine-style layouts. The kinds of layouts you can create with floats are actually somewhat limited. Even a simple sidebar layout built using floats is, technically speaking, a little bit of a hack. Flexbox was invented to break out of these limitations.

We’re finally at a point where browser support has hit critical mass and developers can start building full websites with flexbox. Our recommendation is to use flexbox to lay out your web pages as much as possible, reserving floats for when you need text to flow _around_ a box (i.e., a magazine-style layout) or when you need to support legacy web browsers.
