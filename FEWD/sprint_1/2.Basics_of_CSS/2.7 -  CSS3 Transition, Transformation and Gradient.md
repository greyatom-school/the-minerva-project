## Overview

In the previous section you learnt about flexbox and you have created the beutiful web page. This section will introduce you to CSS3 Transition, Transformation and Gradient.

Transitions allow you to easily animate parts of your design without the need for the likes of JavaScript. Rectangular, at least; level, with four straight sides and four boring right angles. But with the use of transform you can stretch and mold those boxes into all manner of shapes.CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors. After end of this concept you will be able to do this.

## Learning Outcome

- What is CSS Transition?
- What is CSS Transformation?
- What is CSS Gradient?

### CSS Transition

Normally when the value of a CSS property changes, the rendered result is instantly updated, with the affected elements immediately changing from the old property value to the new property value. This section describes a way to specify transitions using new CSS properties. These properties are used to animate smoothly from the old state to the new state over time.

#### What you must do?

- The transition property, however, is much more powerful, allowing smooth animation (rather than a jump from one state to another)[A complete guide to CSS transitions](https://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/advanced/transitions/). Do checkout the examples section in the link.

### CSS Transform

The CSS visual formatting model describes a coordinate system within each element is positioned. Positions and sizes in this coordinate space can be thought of as being expressed in pixels, starting in the origin of point with positive values proceeding to the right and down.

This coordinate space can be modified with the `transform` property. Using transform, elements can be translated, rotated and scaled.

### CSS Gradients

WebKit paved the way for gradients in CSS by adding support for `-webkit-gradient` back in early 2008, and they’ve become widely used since their introduction.

Over the past several months, the CSS Working Group has had extended discussions about making the gradient syntax easier to use, and recently Tab Atkins included a proposal in the latest draft of the [Image Values and Replaced Content module](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-images/). WebKit and Mozilla have now implemented this proposal so that web authors can experiment with it, and provide feedback to the Working Group.

The main goal of the new syntax is simplicity; it’s now really easy to code up common gradients. A secondary goal was to specify something where implementations were compatible across browsers.

CSS defines two types of gradients:

- **Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)**
- **Radial Gradients (defined by their center)**

- The transition property is a shorthand property used to represent up to four transition-related longhand properties [Learn Transitions with examples](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/)
- The transform property allows you to visually manipulate an element by skewing, rotating, translating, or scaling[Learn Transform with examples](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/)
- Gradients are typically one color that fades into another, but in CSS you can control every aspect of how that happens, from the direction to the colors (as many as you want) to where those color changes happen.

### Summary

In this topic, we learnt about a CSS Transition, Transform and Gradient which add a visual appeal to your site.


# Coding Practice

Now we have clear idea about gradients. Let's start making building block of 'Airbnb homestay page' 

Following is screen we are aiming for after finishing this coding task:
