## Overview

In the previous section you have learnt about scrollbars, visisbility and display. When it comes to building layouts and positioning content on a page there are a handful of different techniques to use. Which technique to use largely depends on the content and the goals of the page, as some techniques may be better than others.

This section will introduce you to CSS positioning for setting the layout. As the current page is look like very simple we are going to do the proper partition of page so that web page looks wonderful for reading. After this concept you will be able to do this.

## Learning Outcome

- Why do we need to position elements?
- Which properties help in positioning the element?
- How and why do you let an element float on the page?

### CSS Layout and Positioning

The ability to float elements side by side provides a nice, clean layout that is receptive to the different elements on a page. However, when more strict control is needed, elements may be positioned using other techniques, including `relative` or `absolute` positioning.

As per our experience, we strongly suggest you to not use the `float` property as there are better means to configure your layout and it becomes tedious to handle the positioning of such elements later on. But, do read about it thoroughly as legacy applications and some developers still use float. You might never know what projects you'd have to work with.

#### What you must do?

- Read about [the properties used for positioning and floating elements on the web page](https://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/intermediate/layout/). Do not skip the examples section to thoroughly understand all the concepts.
- We would covering layout system used wide ly by the industry i.e Flexbox in the next unit. But, there is another method for laying out items that's quickly been picked up by the developers i.e CSS Grids. [Go through the complete guide of CSS Grids](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
- In order to make more complex layouts, we need to discuss the position property. It has a bunch of possible values, and their names make no sense and are impossible to remember. Let's go through them one by one [A visual treat to understand positioning](https://learnlayout.com/position.html)

### Summary

In this topic, we learnt about CSS layout and positioning.

As mentioned before, try to avoid using float. It's for educational purposes and it should only be used if some other developer has used it and it's very tricky to replace his/her code.

Positioning is usually used for stacking e.g. I want to show an image on top of another. It would not necessarily used for the same. You can also override an existing element that has been positioned with an another value of the `position` property

# Coding Practice

Now we have clear idea about layout and positioning and different types of css styles. Let's start making building block of 'Airbnb homestay page'

Following is screen we are aiming for after finishing this coding task:
