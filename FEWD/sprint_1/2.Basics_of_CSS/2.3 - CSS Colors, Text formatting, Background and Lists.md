After this section your page look like this.

### CSS Pseudos

A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.

A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.

Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (:visited, for example), the status of its content (like :checked on certain form elements), or the position of the mouse (like :hover, which lets you know if the mouse is over an element or not).

### What you must do?

- Read about [how to add some special effects to CSS selectors](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.htm)
- Read about syntax of pseudo-element and [how to apply or change the state of a selector or element](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.htm)

## Summary

In this topic, we learnt about CSS colors and the values we can use to apply those colors, how to format text content on the webpage and styling lists.

A Webpage looks incomplete without styling it's content and more than half the content is styled using the properties you learnt in this unit. You'd also be applying it in various sections of the final project.
