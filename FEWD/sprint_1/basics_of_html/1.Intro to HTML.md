## Overview

This section will help you understand the language that is used to set up the structure of the web page rendered on the browser. We have already covered this topic in our introductory sprint. You can consider this section as a part of a revision. At the end of this concept you will be able to create airbnb page

## Learning Outcome

- What is HTML?
- What are document types?
- What are HTML elements, tags & attributes and how to use it?

### What is HTML?

The answer to what does HTML stand for is simple: **HyperText Markup Language**. It is a language that allows you to define the structure of the content in your web page by using elements wrapped in universally browser supported tags.

After learning HTML basics, you will be able to perform many changes to your page:

**Content structure**: make your websites easy-to-read and improve user experience by dividing texts into paragraphs, lists, quotes, and headings.
**Graphics**: add images, music, video, or interactive content into your website.
**Comments**: include additional information and remarks for people who might read your HTML code.

**NOTE: To practice and view your changes, create a file with the extension **.html** (e.g index.html), open it in the editor of your choice though we recommend that you use **VSCode** and write html. Double click the html file to open in the browser after changes are saved. Whenever you make changes, save it and reload the page in browser.**

### History of HTML?

HTML 1 was created by a CERN scientist Tim Berners-Lee. His initial goal was an Internet-based hypertext system that allows sharing and using documents in different computers. Introduced in 1991, HTML 1 only had 18 tags, most of them based on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). HTML 2 was presented in 1995 and had a few more features.

The draft of HTML 3 was abandoned due to slow implementation of the newly created tags. Therefore, the World Wide Web Consortium set out to standardize HTML. In 1997, HTML 3.2 was released which became a standard at the time.

HTML 4 was a large step, as it separated styling from coding, leaving the former to CSS. A revised version called HTML 4.01 came out in 1999, correcting minor mistakes found in HTML 4.0 and introducing a few handy features.

HTML 5 is the HTML as we know it today.

Note: you might come upon phrases like 'The difference between HTML and HTML5' or 'HTML vs HTML5'. Don't get confused: developers nowadays use the generic name HTML to refer to all versions prior to HTML5.

### What is a HTML Document type?

A Document Type Declaration, or **DOCTYPE** for short, is an instruction to the web browser about the version of markup language in which a web page is written.

A DOCTYPE declaration appears at the top of a web page before all other elements. According to the HTML specification or standards, every HTML document requires a valid document type declaration to insure that your web pages are displayed the way they are intended to be displayed.

The doctype declaration is usually the very first thing defined in an HTML document (even before the opening [`<html>`](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-reference/html-html-tag.php) tag; however the doctype declaration itself is not an HTML tag.

#### What you must do?

- Though we have provided enough information about HTML DOCTYPE, go through the link to get a better understanding of various [DOCTYPES](https://html.com/tags/doctype/) that are available though you might never use it.
- Please read about the HTML5 Style Guide and Coding Conventions
 [best practices of HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp). so that you will get better understanding of HTML5

### What are HTML elements and tags?

When referring to HTML, the code is made up of sets of characters between angled (<>) brackets; often referred to as tags. For example, `<p>` tag - defines a paragraph.

An HTML element usually consists of a **start** tag and an **end** tag, with the content inserted in between:

`<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>`

The HTML **element** is everything from the start tag to the end tag including the content:

`<p>My first paragraph.</p>`

#### What you must do?

- An HTML file is made of elements. These elements are responsible for creating web pages and define content in that webpage. An element in HTML usually consist of a start tag <tag name>, close tag </tag name> and content inserted between them. Technically, an element is a collection of start tag, attributes, end tag, content between them.Read about [elements and types of HTML elements](https://www.javatpoint.com/html-elements)

- Understand the difference between [HTML elements and tags](https://www.lifewire.com/html-tag-vs-element-3466507)

- **Semantic HTML** is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the meaning of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely defining its presentation or look. Read about some commonly used HTML elements "[What is semantic HTML?](https://www.lifewire.com/why-use-semantic-html-3468271)"

### What are HTML attributes?

An attribute is used to provide extra or additional information about an element.

- All HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information about an element.
- It takes two parameters : **a name and a value.** These define the properties of the element and is placed inside the opening tag of the element. The name parameter takes the name of the property we would like to assign to the element and the value takes the properties value or extent of the property names that can be aligned over the element.
- Every name has some value that must be written within quotes.

**Syntax:**

`<element attribute_name="attribute_value">`

#### What you must do?

- Go through the [**link**](https://html-css-js.com/html/tutorial/html-tag-attributes.php) to get an in-depth perspective of how attributes are applied to a tag. You'll find a list of attributes at the bottom of the page on clicking the link. You do not have to mug up all the attributes. A simple google search would help with the description and the functioality of anny attribute. Just go through the list to get an idea of the list of attributes availableat your disposal.

### Additional References

This section contains some additional helpful links.

- A reference to the list of [HTML elements](https://www.htmlquick.com/reference/tags.html). You don't really have to remember the definition of each and every html element. With practice and time, you'll get used to using these elements. Feel free to always google before using any tag or if you need to find if there is a tag to get your job done. For example, if I want to render an image, I'll search if there are any tags which would help me in rendering an image on the webpage.

### Summary

In this topic, we learnt what's HTML and HTML elements, tags and attributes. This is the building block of building the structure of a web site or app. It is impossible to build websites or apps without HTML elements and attributes.
