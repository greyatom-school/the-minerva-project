## Overview

In the last topic you learnt about creating tables. This section will help you understand the concept of displaying forms in HTML to collect relevant data from the user.

A form is a component of a Web page that has form controls, such as text fields, buttons, checkboxes, range controls, or color pickers. A user can interact with such a form, providing data that can then be sent to the server for further processing (e.g., returning the results of a search or user registration). No client-side javascript is needed to submit forms, though developers do use it to augment the user experience and another level of security. After end of this topic will be able to create this.

### HTML Forms

Building a form consists of several steps, which can be performed in any order: creating the user interface, implementing the server-side logic to process the form ad save the data, and configuring the user interface to communicate with the server.
