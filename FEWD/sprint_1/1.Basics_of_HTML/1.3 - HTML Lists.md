### HTML Lists

Lists are used to group together related pieces of information so they are clearly associated with each other and easy to read. In modern web development, lists are workhorse elements, frequently used for navigation as well as general content.

Lists are good from a structural point of view as they help create a well-structured, more accessible, easy-to-maintain document. They are also useful because they provide specialized elements to which you can attach CSS styles. Finally, semantically correct lists help visitors read your web site, and they simplify maintenance when your pages need to be updated.

### The three list types

There are three list types in HTML:

- **unordered list** — used to group a set of related items in no particular order
- **ordered list** — used to group a set of related items in a specific order
- **description list** — used to display name/value pairs such as terms and definitions

Each list type has a specific purpose and meaning in a web page.
