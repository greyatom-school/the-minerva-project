### HTML Typography?

Usually, we use css to style the content. But, HTML provides us wth some in built elements to style the text like we do in any other editor.

### What you must do?

- Please go through the [link](http://www.tizag.com/htmlT/htmltext.php) to know how you can render headings and paragraphs.
- HTML tags are used to format the appearance of the text on your web page. This can jazz up the look of the web page, however, too much variety in the text formatting can also look displeasing [A guide to the text formatting tags available in HTML](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/text.php)
- Though the previous link provides an extensive useful list, [in this post you will find few other formatting tags](https://www.javatpoint.com/html-formatting). You can skip the repetetive tags that you have already read about.
- You can also refer [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHA9AJe4CYE) to understand various HTML text formatting tags.

### HTML Images

Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page. Images beautify as well as depict many complex concepts in a simpler way on the web page.

### What you must do?

- Images can add a lot to your page. They can make it look more appealing but they can also convey information much better than words in many circumstances. Including images is not too difficult but there are a few little tricks to doing it well. In this section we'll look at both.

### HTML Style

Though we can style the elements using CSS, they have to be linked with HTML for the styles to be applied.

In our unit covering HTML, if any of the course material asks you to style any element (e.g HTML Table `<table></table>`) use any of the options suggested in the link for practice purposes although we would be covering it in great detail in this sprint later on while learning CSS.

### What you must do?

- Styles in HTML are basically rules that describe how a document will be presented in a browser. Style information can be either attached as a separate document or embedded in the HTML document. Read about [the different paths you can take to style elements](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-style-attribute/)

This section contains some additional helpful links.

- In the beginning, the Web was just text, and it was really quite boring. Fortunately, it wasn't too long before the ability to embed images (and other more interesting types of content) inside web pages was added. There are other types of multimedia to consider, but it is logical to start with the humble `<img>` element, used to embed a simple image in a webpage. In this article we'll look at how to use it in depth, including the basics, annotating it with captions using `<figure>`, and detailing how it relates to CSS background images.

## Summary

In this topic, we learnt how to format texts using HTML elements, rendering images and applying style.

While working on the assignment, you would come across situations where you would have to **style texts and render images**. If you get stuck, remember to go through this unit once again. Look at the image of the UI you'd be building for the final project. You'd see texts and images that'd would have to render while building the webpage.

## Coding Practice

Now we have clear idea about text, images and styles, let's add images into 'Airbnb homestay page'

Following is screen we are aiming for after finishing this coding task:
