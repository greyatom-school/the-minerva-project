### HTML Table

The **HTML `<table>` element** represents tabular data â€” that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.

The HTML table model allows developers to arrange data, preformatted text, images, links, forms, form fields, other tables, etc. into rows and columns of cells.

Table rows may be grouped into a header, footer, and body sections, (via the THEAD, TFOOT and TBODY elements, respectively). Row groups convey additional structural information and may be rendered by user agents in ways that emphasize this structure. User agents may exploit the head/body/foot division to support scrolling of body sections independently of the head and foot sections. When long tables are printed, the head and foot information may be repeated on each page that contains table data.

Developers may also group columns to provide additional structural information. Furthermore, developers may declare column properties at the start of a table definition (via the COLGROUP and COL elements) in a way that enables to render the table incrementally rather than having to wait for all the table data to arrive before rendering.

Table cells may either contain "header" information or "data". Cells may span multiple rows and columns. The HTML 4 table model allows developers to label each cell so that may more easily communicate heading information about the cell to the user. These mechanisms greatly assist users with visual disabilities.

### What you must do?

- In this [post](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-tables/), we'll be covering how to render and apply some basic style to the table, merging a row or column with another row and column, creating nested Tables, adding a caption that describes a table and adding some padding to the cells.
- This [post](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_tables.htm) will help you revise what you leart and applying background image and color.
