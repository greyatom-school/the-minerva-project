# Importance of Documentation

## Overview

Documentation generally sounds boring to most of the developers or testers specially when you are a fresher in the Software Industry. 
However if you speak to an experienced Software professional, Documentation plays a vital role in building and testing the software.

You might wonder why this topic is being discussed now. Well, here are some reasons -

- It is a well known truth that people switch companies in Software Industry quite often (on average between 3-5 years). If we don't have documentation of the code and design, it becomes very difficult to understand the code after a person has left the organization
- In case of any conflicts between team members at any point of time, Documentation can always be referred to find what was finalized at some point by the team.

You might not understand the importance of Documentation now, but once you start working in a software company, everything would make sense and you would hopefully remember me :)

## Introduction 

Test documentation is documentation of artifacts created before or during the testing of software.  

It is a complete suite of documents that allows you to describe and document test planning, test design, test execution, test results that are drawn from the testing activity.
If all this is not documented, the testing gets very unorganized and it becomes difficult to track the testing being performed. 

This might sound exaggerated but when you work to build and test complex software systems, it is literally impossible to get the quality assurance of the software without Documentation.
